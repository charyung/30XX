# 30XX

A Smash clone written in AS3.

Note that I haven't looked at this in a couple years so I'm not 100% on whether it still works. This being posted here is just as a proof of concept kinda thing, I guess. Check out the updated version too.

This was my grade 12 final project. Since we only had a month to work on this, obviously it's not feature complete. I wrote the code for the fighters and the attacks, while my teammate wrote the code the the stage and the UI. I also did all of the art.
